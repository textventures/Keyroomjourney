# Keyroombot
A textventure from the lobby to the keyroom
This textventure takes players from the lobby to the keyroom. It also sets the stage and tone for players to start developing a role to play in the game.
The textventure begins to divide the players into two groups- school wizards and gang wizards. Each group is futher separated to those who will follow rules and those who will break the rules.
The choices needed to survive are dependant on the promise made or refused.
